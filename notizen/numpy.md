# NumPy

Arrays of numbers are the fundamental data structure for data analysis.
Python's primitive values have a large overhead. This information is redundant
in lists, because the same type information is stored for every element. NumPy
arrays are much more efficent than Python's lists―especially for big data sets.
Python also offers an array type without redundant type information. However,
this array type doesn't offer the fast and powerful operations of NumPy's
`ndarray` type.

Conventionally, the NumPy library is imported as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Array Creation

### Arrays of Python Lists

NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists:

```python
ints = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8]) # integer array
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8.1]) # upcast to float because of 8.1
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype='float') # with explicit type parameter
ints = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype='int') # with explicit type parameter
```

NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])
```

### Arrays from Scratch

Numpy offers various functions to generate arrays from scratch. Where a
dimension is required (`dim`), a single number (length), a tuple of two (rows,
columns) or more (1st dimension, 2nd dimension, 3rd dimension, etc.) can be
passed.

- `np.zeros(dim, dtype)`: array of zeros
- `np.ones(dim, dtype)`: array of ones
- `np.full(dim, value)`: array filled with the given value
- `np.arange(start, end, step)`: array with values from start (inclusive) to
  end (exclusive) and given step width; `length=(end-start)/step`
- `np.linspace(from, to, n)`: array with evenly spaced values in interval
  `[from,to]` (both inclusive) of length n
- `np.random.random(dim)`: uniformly distributed random values
- `np.random.noraml(mean, sd, dim)`: normally distributed array with the given
  mean and standard deviation
- `np.random.randint(from, to, dim)`: random integers in the interval
  `[from,to)` (inclusive/exclusive)
- `np.eye(n)`: identity matrix with n rows and columns (values at indices with
  equal row/column index are 1)
- `np.empty(dim)`: uninitialized array, values from current memory content
  (garbage)

### Data Types

The `dtype` parameter can either be passed as a string literal or using a
pre-defined constant:

1. literal: `dtype='int32'`
2. constant: `dtype=np.int32`

Common numeric types are:

- boolean: `Bool_`
- signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
    - `int_`: system's default `long`
    - `intc`: system's default `int`
- unsigned integers: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
- floating point: `float16`, `float32`, `float64` 
    - `float_`: system default
- complex numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`
    - `complex_`: system default
